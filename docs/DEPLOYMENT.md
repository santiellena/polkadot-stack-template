# Deployment

This guide covers the remaining deployable Aperio surfaces: contracts and frontend.

## Contracts

Target: Polkadot TestNet (`420420417`).

```bash
cd contracts/evm && npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY
cd ../pvm && npx hardhat vars set PRIVATE_KEY
cd ../..
./scripts/deploy-paseo.sh
```

The deploy scripts write the resulting addresses to:

- `deployments.json`
- `web/src/config/deployments.ts`
- `cli/aperio/deployments.json`

## Frontend

The frontend is a static Vite app with hash routing and relative assets, so it can run from IPFS gateways and static hosts.

Build locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
```

Deploy locally through Bulletin/IPFS:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh --domain aperio00.dot
```

Deploy through GitHub Actions:

1. Open `Actions`.
2. Run `Deploy Frontend to DotNS`.
3. Provide a DotNS basename.

## Required Secrets

- `PRIVATE_KEY` in Hardhat vars for contract deployment.
- `DOTNS_MNEMONIC` in GitHub Actions if you do not want the workflow fallback account.
- `BULLETIN_MNEMONIC` in GitHub Actions if you do not want the workflow fallback account.

## Frontend Environment

Set these when building hosted releases:

- `VITE_APERIO_REGISTRY_KIND`
- `VITE_APERIO_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`
- `VITE_WS_URL`
- `VITE_ETH_RPC_URL`

The checked-in defaults target the current test deployment.
